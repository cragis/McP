# Prusa i3 Full Upgrade MK3

## Assembly Instructions

### Step 5

#### Parts  

* 4x Self tapping screws
* 2x 359mm v-slots

#### Assembly

:heavy_exclamation_mark: If you know how to tap a hole, use M5x8mm and M5 tap instead of self tapping screw

1. We will pre-tap v-slot with self tapping screw to add Z axis end caps later in the assembly
1. :warning: When using these self-tapping screws, you will want to back the screw out and drill it in a little deeper each time. This helps to clear the hole of the cuttings and allows the tapping process to work more easily. Use a drill/driver if it is too hard.
1. (Optional) Add a bit of generic oil on the self tapping screws
1. On one side of each v-slots, insert carefully the self tapping screws until the head is touching the v-slot (figure 5.1)
1. Unscrew self tapping screws and reserve them for later
1. Clean up v-slots from oil and aluminum residues
