## Supplies

1. Heatbed MK52
1. 300mm of 5mm cable sleeve (the smaller diameter sleeve)
1. Heatbed_cable_cover

## Heatbed assembly

Follow the Prusa instructions: [Prusa manual heatbed assembly](https://manual.prusa3d.com/Guide/7.+Heatbed++&+PSU+assembly+(textile+sleeve)/589?lang=en)

You will be done after step 17. 

## X cable sleeve

Since you just learned how to attach a cable sleeve, you should also attach a cable sleeve to the x_motor.  This step also uses a 300mm long 5mm cable sleeve.  Both the x_motor cable and the x_endstop cable will route through this sleeve.  Secure the sleeve with a cable tie near the x_motor once you are finished.
