## X cable sleeve

Since you just learned how to attach a cable sleeve, you should also attach a cable sleeve to the x_motor.  This step also uses a 300mm long 5mm cable sleeve.  Both the x_motor cable and the x_endstop cable will route through this sleeve.  Secure the sleeve with a cable tie near the x_motor once you are finished.
