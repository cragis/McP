#### Assembly

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Y belt is not visible in these figures and will not be visible in the following ones


1. Ensure correct orientation of the Y carriage as highlighted in figure 10.1

1. Add zip ties with head facing inside the frame as seen on figure 10.2. Ensure zip ties are not touching the bed and y carriage
1. If the bed does not slide smoothly, improve rod spacing/angle<br>
   :warning: this step is very important, take your time and check dimensions from previous step.
1. Loosen, by several turns, the screws holding the y-tensioner.  You will tighten these later to get correct tension in the belt.
1. Mount the Y belt.
1. Take your time to perfectly align y_idler and y_motor_mount to get a good belt alignment
1. Tighten the y_idler mount to get the correct tension for the belt. You can use the Prusa MK3 method from the original manual here : [Step 37 Testing the Y-axis belt](http://manual.prusa3d.com/Guide/2.+Y-axis+assembly/507?lang=en#s8300)

## Supplies

1. Heatbed MK52
1. 350mm of 5mm cable sleeve (the smaller diameter sleeve)
1. Heatbed_cable_cover

## Heatbed assembly

Follow the Prusa instructions: [Prusa manual heatbed assembly](https://manual.prusa3d.com/Guide/7.+Heatbed++&+PSU+assembly+(textile+sleeve)/589?lang=en)

https://github.com/PrusaOwners/prusaowners/wiki/Bed_Leveling_without_Wave_Springs

You will be done after step 17. 

## X cable sleeve

Since you just learned how to attach a cable sleeve, you should also attach a cable sleeve to the x_motor.  This step also uses a 350mm long 5mm cable sleeve.  The x_motor cable will route through this sleeve.  Secure the sleeve with a cable tie near the x_motor once you are finished.
