### Z motors wire

#### Parts  

* 1x 6 pin JST PH connector with 4 300mm wires attached
* 4x 600mm long wires (22 gauge)
* 1x 6 pin JST PH connector
* 4x JST PH pins
* 1x 4 pin JST XH connector
* 4x JST XH pins
* JST crimping tool

#### Assembly

1. Remove the red and black wires form the 6 pin JST PH connector with wires.
1. Cut (and strip, if necessary) each end of each 600mm wire so that about 2mm of bare wire are showing.
1. Crimp JST PH pins (the smaller of the two sizes) on one end of each 600mm wire.
1. Insert the crimped ends into the empty 6 pin JST PH connector.  Remember: blue=1, red=3, green=4, black=6.
1. Crimp JST PH pins on the other end of ONLY the blue and green wires.
1. Insert these two pins into the JST PH connector from which you removed the red and black wires.  IN THIS CASE ONLY, blue goes into 3 and green goes into 6.
1. Crimp JST XH pins on the four remaining ends (the green and blue are shorter wires, the red and black are longer wires).
1. Insert the pins into the XH connector with standard color order.
