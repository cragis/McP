# McP Assembly Instructions: Hand (extruder)

## Extruder
1. Assemble the Extruder.  Instructions are here [Extruder Assembly](https://guides.bear-lab.com/Guide/3.+Extruder/13?lang=en)
   :warning: IMPORTANT: Pay attention to the changes noted below.


## Changes

Step 5: Orient the stepper motor cable connection to the side (with the hexagonal cutout), not the bottom as shown.


Step 7: We are not using a filament sensor, so skip steps 7-11.


Step 16: The collet we will be using is different, it screws into the heat sink until it grasps the teflon tightly.  Make sure the teflon is inserted fully into the heat sink, and put a piece of filament inside the teflon before you tighten the collet.


Step 22: In step 22, we will be using a different proximity sensor.  We will install later.


Step 23: We will wait until later to add the shroud.
