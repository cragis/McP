# McP Assembly Instructions: Hand (extruder)


## Step 1: How to insert nuts

Inserting Hex Nuts: To assure that hex nuts are properly seated, do the following:

1.   Insert a screw through a washer.

 1.   Insert the screw through the hole on the flat side (not the hex cavity side).

   1. Add the hex nut on the screw and tighten the screw.

   1. Ensure the hex nut is aligned with the hex cavity while tightening.

1.    When the nut is full seated, you may remove the screw being careful not to dislodge the nut.

Inserting Nyloc Nuts: You can use the same method as hex nuts.

Inserting Square Nuts: They tend to fall out if the piece holding them is inverted. After they are inserted, check that they are properly seated by inserting a screw to engage that nut.


## Step 2: Extruder parts

## Step 3: Extruder motor 
![](img/emotor_add_pulley.jpg)\

Mount the Bondtech pulley on the extruder motor shaft with the toothed portion on top with the set screw contacting the flat portion of the shaft.

The motor shaft should extend approximately 1mm beyond pulley.

Secure the set screw to prevent the gear from moving. We will fine tune the position later.

Secure the extruder motor to the extruder_body using two M3x25 screws.  Cable mount should be on the right, not on the bottom as the picture shows.

## Step 4: Insert mounting nuts

![](img/nut1.jpg)\

Press an M3 hex nut into the extruder_body.

![](img/nut3.jpg)\

Insert 3 M3 nuts into the x_carriage.

![](img/nut2.jpg)\

Insert 2 M3 nylock nuts into the other side of the x_carriage.

## Step 5: Mount extruder on carriage

blue: Using an M3x10 screw, attach the extruder_body to the x_carriage.

green: Using an M3x40 screw and an M3 washer, attach the extruder_body to the x_carriage.

## Step 6: Extruder idler preparation

Slide two Bondtech needle bearings on the 3x20mm shaft

Lubricate the needle bearings with a dab of lithium based grease

![](img/btech_idler.jpg)\

Place the idler gear into the extruder_idler. Note the orientation of the teeth.

Insert the shaft from the direction shown as on the figure.

Insert a square nut in available pocket.

## Step 7: Extruder idler assembly
![](img/extruder_idler_assembly.jpg)\

Slide an M3x40 screw with an M3 washer into the carriage.

Add the extruder_idler in the opening.

Push the screw all the way in.

Slightly tighten the screw, the extruder_idler must rotate freely.

## Step 8: Prepare hotend

Insert the heater cartridge and the thermistor into the heater block of the hotend.

Get a piece of telfon tubing, 53.5 mm long.

Insert the teflon tubing into the hotend.  There should be 10 mm protruding.

![](img/hotend_insertion.jpg)\

Insert the hotend into the extruder_body.  Be careful to align everthing.  However, it still takes some force to seat it properly.

## Step 9: Extruder cover assembly

![](img/extruder_cover.jpg)\

Insert one M3 square nut and two m3 hex nuts into the nut traps on the extruder_cover.


![](img/extruder_cover_mount.jpg)\

Insert two M3x40 screws to affix the cover and hold the hotend in place.


## Step 10: Hotend fan mount

![](img/hefan_mount.jpg)\

Remove the fan which cools the hotend from the transparent blue plastic duct.

Mount the fan on the extruder using the same screws. 

Route the motor and fan wires as shown in the picture.

## Step 11: Bondtech gear alignment

![](img/btech_alignment.jpg)\

Open the extruder_idler

Insert a piece of 1.75 mm filament through the extruder_body into the PFTE tube.

Using the Bondtech set screw, carefully center the filament on the drive teeth.

Tighten the set screw. Don't tighten too much as you will damage the thread.

Remove the filament.

## Step 12: Nozzle fan mount

![](img/nfan_mount.jpg)\



Slide a M3 washer on a M3x18 screw. Do the same for another M3x18 screw.

Attach the print fan using the screws.

## Step 13: PINDA probe mount

![](img/pinda_mount.jpg)\

Place a square nut in the extruder_body for the pinda_mount.

Slide an M3x10 screw in the pinda_mount and engage the square nut, but do not tighten.

![](img/pinda_cable_routing.jpg)\

Insert the Pinda in the mount so that the sensor end is 12mm below the bottom of the pinda_mount. Tighten the screw just enough to keep the Pinda from falling out. The optimum Pinda position will be adjusted later.

Route the Pinda wires

Route the print fan wires

Secure the cables with a zip tie. Be sure to leave some slack since the Pinda position will need to be adjusted later.

This is an example of how the Pinda and print fan cables should be wired.
