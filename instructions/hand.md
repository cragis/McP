Step 5: orient the stepper motor cable connection to the side, not the bottom as shown.
Step 7: We are not using a filament sensor, so skip steps 7-11.
Step 16: the collet we will be using is different, it screws into the heat sink until it grasps the teflon tightly.  make sure the teflon is inserted fully into the heat sink, and put a piece of filament inside the teflon be fore you tighten the collet.
Step 22: In step 22, we will be using a different proximity sensor.
Step 23: We will wait until later to add the shroud.
