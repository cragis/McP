# McP Assembly Instructions: Hand (extruder)


## Step 1 How to insert nuts

Inserting Hex Nuts: To assure that hex nuts are properly seated, do the following:

1.   Insert a screw through a washer.

 1.   Insert the screw through the hole on the flat side (not the hex cavity side).

   1. Add the hex nut on the screw and tighten the screw.

   1. Ensure the hex nut is aligned with the hex cavity while tightening.

1.    When the nut is full seated, you may remove the screw being careful not to dislodge the nut.

Inserting Nyloc Nuts: You can use the same method as hex nuts.

Inserting Square Nuts: They tend to fall out if the piece holding them is inverted. After they are inserted, check that they are properly seated by inserting a screw to engage that nut.

#### Parts  

* 1x axial fan (from hotend)
* 1x wire: orange 
* 1x wire: white with orange stripe
* heat shrink tubing
* soldering iron
* solder 
* heat gun

#### Assembly
Make an 800mm long cable by soldering more wire onto the fan wires:

1. Cut and strip the black and red wires attached to the fan.
1. Cut the orange and white wires to the length so that when they are added to the fan wires the total length will be 800mm.
1. Strip both ends of the orange and white wire.
1. After putting a short section of heat shrink tubing on the wire, solder the orange and red wires together.
1. After putting a short section of heat shrink tubing on the wire, solder the white and black wires together.
1. Place the heat shink tubing so it covers the soldered section. 
1. Heat the heat shrink tubing with the heat gun until it shrinks into place.
