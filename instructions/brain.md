# McP Assembly Instructions: Brain (microcontroller)


## Step 1: Supplies

These are the supplies you need to assemble the power supply.

1. Microcontroller board
1. x12 jumpers
1. 4x stepper drivers
1. assembled printer


## Step 2: Prepare heatbed wires

You need to cut the ends of the heatbed wire connectors so tht they will fit into the microcontroller terminals.

## Step 3: Prepare inductive sensor connector

You will need to cut the connector of the inductive sensor so that the white wire is separate.

Once the white wire is separated, clean up the end of the connector so the plastic makes a clean end even with the raised piece.

Done.  It is fine if no plastic remains on the end of the white wire.

##Step 4: Connect jumpers

Add 12 jumpers to the pins

## Step 4: Attach screws to frame

Attach two M5x8mm screws to the frame with slide in t-nuts.  They slide in the leftmost back slot in the upright.

## Step 5: Mount brain box

1. Mount the brain box using the screws from previous step, leaving both screws loose.
1. The brain box should sit as low as it can, resting on top of the corner connector. The outer edge of the brain box should be flush with the leftmost edge of the frame upright.
1. Tighten the upper screw, leaving the lower loose.

## Step 6: Route x cable

1. Rotate the brain box so that x cable can be routed between the brain box and the upright.
1. The x cable goes into the hexagonal hole in the edge of the brain box.
1. Rotate the brain box with the x cable so that the edge again is flush with the upright.
1. Make sure only a small amount (~1cm) of the sleeve is inside the brain box.
1. Tighten both of the M5 screws holding the brain box against the frame.



## Step 7: Attach brain

Using 4 M3x10mm screws and nuts, mount the microcontroller board in the brain box.  Make sure the green terminals are at the bottom.
