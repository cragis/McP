### Extruder cooling fan wire

#### Parts  

* 1x axial fan
* 1x wire: orange, 520mm long
* 1x wire: white with orange stripe, 520mm long
* heat shrink tubing
* soldering iron
* solder 
* heat gun
* 1x 2 pin JST XH connector
* 2x JST XH pins

#### Assembly
Make an 800mm long cable by soldering more wire onto the fan wires:

1. Cut and strip the black and red wires attached to the fan.
1. Cut the orange and white wires to a length so that when they are added to the fan wires the total length will be 800mm.
1. Strip both ends of the orange and white wire.
1. Before soldering the wires together, remember to add a short section of heat shrink tubing on the wire.
(One can use electrical tape instead of heat shrink tubing, but it is crucial that the wires do not short to each other or any other wires that will run from the hand to the brain.)
1. After putting a short section of heat shrink tubing on the wire, solder the orange and red wires together.
1. After putting a short section of heat shrink tubing on the wire, solder the white and black wires together.
1. Place the heat shink tubing so it covers the soldered section. 
1. Heat the heat shrink tubing with the heat gun until it shrinks into place.
1. Test that fan works by using two 9V batteries in series.  Touch the positive terminal to the orange wire and the negative terminal to the white wire.  Verify that the fan is turning. 
1. Add the JST XH pins to the free ends of the orange and white wires.
1. Assemble the JST XH connector with the orange wire in pin one (the pin closest to the cutout) and the white wire in pin 2.

It is, of course, acceptable to use other wire colors, but it is crucial to remember and be able to identify the connector used for this fan as opposed to the connector used for the extrusion cooling fan that you will assemble next. 


### Extrusion cooling fan wire

Same procedure as for the Extruder cooling fan, but using different colored wire so that the two can be distinguished. 

#### Parts  

* 1x radial fan
* 1x wire: blue, 520mm long
* 1x wire: white with blue stripe, 520mm long
* heat shrink tubing
* soldering iron
* solder 
* heat gun
* 1x 2 pin JST XH connector
* 2x JST XH pins
