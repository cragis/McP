* 1x axial fan (from hotend)
* 1x wire: orange 
* 1x wire: white with orange stripe

#### Assembly
Make an 800mm long cable by soldering more wire onto the fan wires:

1. Cut and strip the black and red wires attached to the fan.
1. Cut the orange and white wires to the length so that when they are added to the fan wires the total length will be 800mm.
1. Strip both ends of the orange and white wire.
1. After putting a short section of heat shrink tubing on the wire, solder the orange and red wires together.
1. After putting a short section of heat shrink tubing on the wire, solder the white and black wires together.
1. Place the heat shink tubing so it covers the soldered section. 
1. Heat the heat shrink tubing with the heat gun until it shrinks into place.
