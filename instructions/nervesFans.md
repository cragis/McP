### Extrusion cooling fan wire

#### Parts  

* 1x radial fan
* 1x wire: orange, 520mm long
* 1x wire: white with orange stripe, 520mm long
* heat shrink tubing
* soldering iron
* solder 
* heat gun

#### Assembly
Make an 800mm long cable by soldering more wire onto the fan wires:

1. Cut and strip the black and red wires attached to the fan.
1. Cut the orange and white wires to a length so that when they are added to the fan wires the total length will be 800mm.
1. Strip both ends of the orange and white wire.
1. Before soldering the wires together, remember to add a short section of heat shrink tubing as shown:

1. After putting a short section of heat shrink tubing on the wire, solder the orange and red wires together.
1. After putting a short section of heat shrink tubing on the wire, solder the white and black wires together.

1. Place the heat shink tubing so it covers the soldered section. 
1. Heat the heat shrink tubing with the heat gun until it shrinks into place.

1. Test that fan works by using two 9V batteries in series.  Touch the positive terminal to the orange wire and the negative terminal to the white wire.  Verify that fan is turning. 

It is, of course, acceptable to use other wire colors, but it is crucial that you remember what color you connected to red and what color you connected to black.
