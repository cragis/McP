### Hotend fan wire

#### Parts  

* 1x axial fan (from hotend)
* 1x wire: orange, 520mm long
* 1x wire: white with orange stripe, 520mm long
* heat shrink tubing
* soldering iron
* solder 
* heat gun

#### Assembly
Make an 800mm long cable by soldering more wire onto the fan wires:

1. Cut and strip the black and red wires attached to the fan.
1. Cut the orange and white wires to the length so that when they are added to the fan wires the total length will be 800mm.
1. Strip both ends of the orange and white wire.
1. After putting a short section of heat shrink tubing on the wire, solder the orange and red wires together.
1. After putting a short section of heat shrink tubing on the wire, solder the white and black wires together.
1. Place the heat shink tubing so it covers the soldered section. 
1. Heat the heat shrink tubing with the heat gun until it shrinks into place.

### Extrusion cooling fan wire

#### Parts  

* 1x radial fan 
* 1x wire: blue, 520mm long 
* 1x wire: white with blue stripe, 520mm long
* heat shrink tubing
* soldering iron
* solder 
* heat gun

#### Assembly
Make an 800mm long cable by soldering more wire onto the fan wires, exactly as above, but with blue instead of orange:

1. Cut and strip the black and red wires attached to the fan.
1. Cut the blue and white wires to the length so that when they are added to the fan wires the total length will be 800mm.
1. Strip both ends of the orange and white wire.
1. After putting a short section of heat shrink tubing on the wire, solder the blue and red wires together.
1. After putting a short section of heat shrink tubing on the wire, solder the white and black wires together.
1. Place the heat shink tubing so it covers the soldered section. 
1. Heat the heat shrink tubing with the heat gun until it shrinks into place.
