# McP Assembly Instructions

## Nerves

Generally, you will be making wires with JST connectors on the ends.  Each JST connector has a small indicator cutout near one pin.  We will call that pin one, and the rest two, three, et cetera.  

Our JST connectors for the motors will have blue, red, green, and black wires.  For the 4 pin JST XH ends: black=1, green=2, blue=3, red=4.  However, for the 6 pin JST PH ends: black=1, blue=3, green=4, red=6, and pins 2 and 5 are not connected.
