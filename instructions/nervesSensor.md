#### Assembly

You need to make a longer cable for the 5 wires for the proximity sensor.  It is easiest if you use extend each wire with a wire of the same color.
Make an 800mm long cable by soldering more wire onto the proximity sensor wires:

For each wire
1. Cut and strip the wire attached to the sensor.
1. Cut the new wire to a length so that when they are added to the sensor wire the total length will be 800mm.
1. Strip both ends of the two wires to be joined.
1. Before soldering the wires together, remember to add a short section of heat shrink tubing on the wire.
(One can use electrical tape instead of heat shrink tubing, but it is crucial that the wires do not short to each other or any other wires that will run from the hand to the brain.)
1. After putting a short section of heat shrink tubing on the wire, solder the wires together.
1. Place the heat shink tubing so it covers the soldered section. 
1. Heat the heat shrink tubing with the heat gun until it shrinks into place.


After finishing all 5 wires
1. Add the JST XH pins to the free ends of the five wires.
1. Assemble the 3 pin JST XH connector with the brown wire in pin one (the pin closest to the cutout), the red wire in pin 2, and the yellow wire in pin 3.
1. Assemble the 2 pin JST XH connector with the black wire in pin one (the pin closest to the cutout) and the white wire in pin 2.
