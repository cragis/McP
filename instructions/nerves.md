# McP Assembly Instructions

## Nerves

Generally, you will be making wires with JST connectors on the ends.  Each JST connector has a small indicator cutout near one pin.  We will call that pin one, and the rest two, three, et cetera.  

Our JST connectors for the motors will have blue, red, green, and black wires in that order.  For the 4 pin JST XH ends: blue=1, red=2, green=3, black=4.  However, for the 6 pin JST PH ends: blue=1, red=3, green=4, black=6, and pins 2 and 5 are not connected.

### X motor wire
 


#### Parts  

* 1x 6 pin JST PH connector with 4 300mm wires attached
* 1x 4 pin JST XH connector
* 4x JST XH pins
* JST crimping tool

#### Assembly

1. Cut (and strip, if necessary) each wire so that about 2mm of bare wire are showing.
1. Insert one JST XH pin in the crimping tool.  Close partially the crimping tool gently until the pin is no longer loose.
1. Insert the end of the wire into the pin in the crimping tool until it stops.  Insulation on wire should be slightly inside the jaws of the crimping tool.
1. Close the crimping tool completely.
1. Open the crimping tool and remove the wire and pin.  Check to see that the quality of crimp is good.
1. Repeat for the remaining three pins.
1. Insert the pins into the connector.  Make sure that blue=1, red=2, green=3, black=4.
