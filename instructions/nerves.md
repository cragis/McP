### X motor wire

#### Parts  

* 1x 6 pin JST PH connector with 4 300mm wires attached
* 1x 4 pin JST XH connector
* 4x JST XH pins
* JST crimping tool

#### Assembly

1. Cut (and strip, if necessary) each wire so that about 2mm of bare wire are showing.
1. Insert one JST XH pin in the crimping tool.  Close partially the crimping tool gently until the pin is no longer loose.
1. Insert the end of the wire into the pin in the crimping tooluntil it stops.  Insulation on wire should be slightly inside the jaws of the crimping tool.
1. Close the crimping tool completely.
1. Open the crimping tool and remove the wire and pin.  Check to see that the quality of crimp is good.
1. Repeat for the remaining three pins.
1. Insert the pins into the connector.  Make sure that first wire leads to top terminal on both ends if both connectors have their clip side facing you.  Same with second through fourth wires.
