## Assembly Instructions

### Bones

#### Parts  

* 1x 290mm v-slot
* 2x 359mm v-slots
* 2x 331mm v-slots
* 2x 370mm v-slots
* 16x M5x12mm screws

#### Preparation

If you are assembling for "DIY Manufacture", all preparation steps except the last on have been done for you.

##### 370mm pieces
1. The 370mm pieces each need four holes drilled. All four are in the same channel, 10mm and 30mm from each end.

##### 359mm pieces
1. The 359mm pieces each need two holes drilled through the larger (40mm) thickness, 10mm and 30mm from one end.
1. Both center holes on the other end of the pieces need to be tapped for M5 screws.

##### 331mm pieces

1. The 331mm pieces each need two holes drilled, one through each channel.  These should be 106mm from one end.
1. All four center holes on the ends of each piece need to be tapped for M5 screws.

##### 290mm piece

1. All four center holes on the end of this piece need to be tapped for M5 screws.
1. For those in "DIY Manufacture" one end is already tapped, you need to tap the other.  Tap as deep as the tap will go using the plastic tap/v-slot alignment guide.

#### Assembly

1. Insert a screw into each threaded end of each v-slot.  Some ends are not threaded.  You should use all 16 screws.
1. Each screw should be about 3mm from fully screwed in so that each screw can be slid into a v-slot.
1. Slide the pieces together to make the frame shape shown in figure 7.4.
1. Loosely tighten each screw so that the frame doesn't fall apart, but can still be adjusted.
1. Check the base is not twisted by pressing down each corner.
1. If it is twisted, place an object (in red on figure 4.2) under one corner and apply pressure simultaneously to both perpendicular corners (A and B). Repeat this for left and right side until you get a perfectly flat frame.
1. Make sure the base is flat so that all four corners can touch when placed on a flat surface.  If not, place a small flat object under on of the low corners and push down on the 
1. Make sure that each upright is 106mm from the back.

1. Make sure the uprights are square to the base, in both directions.

1. Make sure the crossbar is square to the uprights.
1. For improved rigidity, trianglular corner braces should be added at the left and right edges of the upright.  Make sure they are on the back (shorter) side.
1. For more rigidity, more trianglular corner braces can be added.  This step is optional.
