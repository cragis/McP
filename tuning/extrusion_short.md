## Measure extrusion

You may need to measure if your extruder is extruding the amount of filament that it thinks it is.

1. Preheat for PET and wait until temperature is reached.
1. Make a sharpie mark on the filament about (precision not necessary) 10cm (100mm) above where it enters the extruder.
1. Using calipers, measure the distance along the filament from the top of the extruder to this mark. Record this value. (Precision is necessary.)
1. Go to the setting to move the extruder axis by 10mm steps.
1. Turn the knob one tick clockwise to extrude 10mm of filament.
1. Once the extruder stops turning, measure and record the distance again.
1. Repeat until your mark disappears into the extruder.

If you now make a plot of expected position (0mm, 10mm, 20mm, 30mm, ...) vs. your measured length, the slope will be the factor by which you should multiply the extruder calibration.  Ask for help if you need it.
